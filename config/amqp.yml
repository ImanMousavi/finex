    # You can set queue maximum length (see https://www.rabbitmq.com/maxlength.html).
    # For order matching queue it is recommended to set limit about to 10000 per market.
    # So in case you have 10 markets you would set 1000000. But this value is relative and depends on your business (market load).
    #
    # max_length: 10000
    #
    # Alternatively you can pass custom arguments here (for example in case your use RabbitMQ plugins):
    #
    # arguments:
    #   x-max-length: 10000
    #
    # When you change any parameter of queue definition it is required to drop it in RabbitMQ admin panel.
    # In case you want this to be done transparently and automatically I recommend to set auto_delete to true.
    #
    # auto_delete: true
    #
    # In such case queue will be deleted automatically once all workers are disconnected. This should ensure queue
    # is created from scratch with new configuration at next redeployment.
